Step 3 - adding some code with formatting

(my tilde/backtick key does not work :( ) - I used sharpkeys to map my right control key to this 

``` R
a <- [1:3]
b <- [5,6,7,7,9]
c <- a + b
```
###### Yeehaaaw mapping worked

Here is code without R syntaz highlighting
``` 
a <- [1:3]
b <- [5,6,7,7,9]
c <- a + b
```
